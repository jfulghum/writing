  <li> "The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.
Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think. What I'm telling you is that you should worry? Yes, but it's not as bad as it sounds. It's exhilarating to overcome worries. You don't see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they're so happy? Relief.
I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy. Just that some kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound."

<p class="quote"> <li>"Anyone can learn physics. Anyone can learn math. Being “good at it” or “smart” is beside the point. If we enacted the same set of rules for being allowed to learn a topic to any other area of study, it would be disastrous: only a select few would be allowed to read Plato, we wouldn’t let people study a foreign language if they weren’t able to learn it in a few weeks, and people wouldn’t be allowed to play guitar unless they had a decent shot at being a famous musician. That is how ridiculous it is."

    <li> Writing is thinking. To believe that something in your head feels clear, is thinking, is a very dangerous thing. When you try to put in down on a page in a structured order that someone else can digest, and you find you can’t… writing ideas down and laying the ideas out is thinking. Sitting and starting out a window, maybe with a cigarette, whatever you think it is... It’s only when you are writing down, getting order into your thoughts on the page so that another person can get into the context, the perspective that you are pulling in to have your worldview. 
Writing is thinking, and thinking is hard work.

   **Kill Bill spoiler alert below**
   <br>
   *after she left him and was about to secretly marry another man, Bill murdered The Bride's entire wedding party and attempted to kill her and her unborn baby*
   <br>Bill: Was my reaction really that surprising? </br>
<br>The Bride: Yes, it was. Could you do what you did? Of course you could. But, I never thought you could or would do that to me.</br>
<br>Bill: I'm really sorry, Kiddo. You thought wrong.</br>

  <br><br>I love that one. If someone you love is doing something evil to another, you're a fool to think they'd never do it to you. When I read the following line in Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, I like was like, "Yesss, the Kiddo line!" "... and one more thought, from Apollo: That to expect bad people not to injure others is crazy. It's to ask the impossible. And to let them behave like that to other people but to expect them to exempt you is arrogant - the act of a tyrant." It also reminds me of the Socrates quote: "no evil can befall a good man", which I am still chewing over.
