Current work in anthropology, however, shows us that the reason most West Africans (or many other of the world’s peoples) had not created the kind of “civilizations” that Europeans had was largely an accident of geography. The plants and animals thriving on a particular temperate latitude were uniquely amenable to cultivation, naturally yielding a volume of surplus that swelled populations, thus in turn facilitating densely hierarchical societies where certain classes had the leisure to create technology.

A people can only hit the highest note when it has the incentive to do so.
<br>
To enshrine “diversity” over true excellence nothing less than condemns black students to mediocrity.
<br>
This is the inevitable result, regardless of good intentions, of denying them the one thing that elicits the best in anyone: the unavailability of any path but individual initiative and perseverance.
<br>
The emotional balm of intoning “We owe them” is obvious, but what makes whites feel goodly does not necessarily give black students the tools to truly excel. As I have written and said before, one can only learn to ride a bicycle by being let go to master the subtle muscular poise of the endeavor by oneself—as long as the training wheels are on, one is not truly riding a bike. Birds learn to fly by being dropped out of the nest. One gains fluent command of a foreign language by living for an extended period in a setting where it is impossible to use one’s native tongue for any length of time.
<br>
Asian students, for example, have never had the occasion to embrace the illusion that there was any way to the top but showing their stuff hell or high water, which is why they do so in such large numbers. A university administration culture where black students are denied the opportunity to do this is, quite simply, a racist one. 
<br>
Pushing it? Maybe. But what are we to make of various university officials’ apparent conviction that black people are the only ones in American history who cannot triumph over societal and historical obstacles?
