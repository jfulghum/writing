"Jacaranda realized that no matter where Max was sitting, what hotel, in what city - or when, he would forever feel like home. He was a tango partner whom after an absence of forty years, she would remember perfectly, even if she was blind."

"Every time between Max and Jacaranda was different, but it was always a tango, and the tango is not a dance that lends itself to much beyond sex and rage. The tango is a embrace popular among sowers of wild oats who regret nothing."
- Sex and Rage, by Eve Babitz
