"Learning to survive, no matter with what cravenness and caution, what shocks and forebodings, is not the same as being miserable. It is too interesting."

"Flo was his [her father's] idea of what a woman ought to be. Rose knew that, and indeed he often said it. A woman ought to be energetic, practical, clever 
  at making and saving; she ought to be shrewd, good at bargaining and bossing and seeing through people's pretensions. At the same time she 
  should be naive intellectually, childlike, contemptuous of maps and long words and anything in books, full of charming jumbled notions, 
  superstitions, traditional beliefs." <br>
<br>
<br>



“Rose hated her at these times, hated her father as well; his sickness; the poverty or frugality that made it unthinkable for them to send things to the laundry; 
  the way there was not a thing in their lives they were protected from. Flo was there to see to that.”

<!-- Horse Nicholson had made a lot of money as a contractor and had left that to go into politics. He had made a speech saying that what they needed was a lot more God in the classroom and a lot less French. -->

"They took along their own sandwiches and bought milk from the vendor on the train. It was sour. Sour chocolate milk.
 Rose kept taking tiny sips, unwilling to admit that something so much desired could fail her.

Not a Frenchman at all, really, his name was McLaren, but Rose thought teaching French had rubbed off on him, made him look like one, 
  Quick and sallow, sharp shoulders; hooked nose and sad eyes.
She saw him lapping and coiling his way through slow pleasures, a perfect autocrat of indulgences.
<br>
She had a considerable longing to be somebody's object.
  <br>
Pounded, pleasured, reduced, exhausted.
<br>
...
<br>
She never saw him again in her life. But he remained on call, so to speak, for years and years, ready to slip into place at a critical moment, 
  without even any regard, later on, for husband or lovers."
