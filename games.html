<h2>Games</h2>
<p>I learn the most building and collobrating with others. Here are some games I've built with friends.</p>
<br>
<p> <a href="https://jfulghum.github.io/teaSet/">Tea Set</a></p>

<p>Based on the classic matching card game "Set", Tea Set was built over three days by Ralph Salazar, Guilia Lake and Johanna Fulghum. </p>
<br>
  <p><a href="https://jfulghum.github.io/Vanilla-Mastermind/">Mastermind</a> </p>
<p>This Mastermind game was created by Giulia Lake and Johanna Fulghum using vanilla Javascript, with jasmine as our test suite.

<p><a href="https://citybikegirl.herokuapp.com/">Citibike Girl</a></p>
<p>Inspired by biking adventures in NYC, this game was built in Phaser3 by Ana Sanchez and Johanna Fulghum.</p>
