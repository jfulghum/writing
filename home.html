   <h2>Welcome.</h2>
   <div class="intro">
      <p>My name is Johanna Fulghum. One day in January 2020 I was feeling so inspired by Susan Fowler's <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/reading-list">reading list</a> that I decided to create my <a href="http://johannafulghum.com/">own.</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      These days I work as an backend software engineer in Denver, CO. 
          </br>
      <br>I also host a weekly coffee shop meetup called "Deep Learning in Denver", where I try to replicate the incredible programming meetups that taught me so much in New York City from 2017-2020. 
      </br>
      <br>Before my stint in NYC, I worked as an economist for almost four years in Washington D.C, and I still feel like one at heart.</br>

      Shoutout to the <a href="https://codenation.org/">Code Nation</a> Lower East Side high schoolers -
      <br>Working with those students both inspired me and taught me how to create this site. </br>
      <br>
      I have million hobbies. A few of them are soccer, rock climbing, languages, and mountain biking.
