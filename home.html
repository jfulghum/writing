<h2>Welcome.</h2>
<div class="intro">
<p>My name is Johanna Fulghum. I'm a writer, economist, and engineer living in Denver, CO. </p>
  

  <br>
<p>One day in January 2020 I was feeling so inspired by Susan Fowler's <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/reading-list">reading list</a> that I decided to create my <a href="http://johannafulghum.com/">own.</a></p>
  <br>
  <p>I work as an backend software engineer at a software company based in Denver, CO. </br>
    Before moving to New York, I worked as an economist for almost four years in Washington D.C. and I still feel like one at heart.</br>
  </br>
  
I volunteer with <a href="https://codenation.org/">Code Nation</a> to teach web development to high schoolers in the Lower East Side twice a week. </br>
  Working with the kids both inspired me and taught me how to create this site. </br>
</p>
    <br>
<p>I have million hobbies. A few of them are soccer, rock climbing, and mountain biking.</p>
