<h2>Welcome.</h2>
<p>My name is Johanna Fulghum, and currently this site is a blatant ripoff of Susan Fowler's, an engineer and writer I really admire. </p>
<p>I was so impressed with her <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/reading-list">reading list</a> I decided to create my own. </p>
<p>I know I want to write and read more, and I hope being able share it all with you here will motivate me to do just that.</p>
<p>Thank you github pages!</p>
<p>A little about me, I work as an operations engineer at a healthcare start-up in New York City.</p>
<p>I also volunteer with <a href="https://codenation.org/">Code Nation</a> to teach html, css, and javascript to underserved high schoolers in the Lower East Side.</p>
<pWorking on web development with the kids inspired me to finally create this site.</p>
<p>Before moving to New York, I worked as an economist for almost four years in Washington D.C. </p>
<p>When I'm not reading, writing, or coding, I love to play soccer, rock climb, and <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/cunningham-park">mountain bike.</a></p>
