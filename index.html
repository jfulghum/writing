<h2>My Reading List</h2>
<p><br />Thank you to <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/reading-list"> Susan Fowler</a> and <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf">Patrick Collision</a> who have inspired me to devote more time to reading and to create this list. <br /> <br /> ★★ is Not Great. Can't recommend. <br /> ★★1/2 Okay, didn't do it for me. <br /> ★★★ Enjoyable &amp; overall yes recommendation. <br /> ★★★1/2 Very Good, strong recommendation. <br /> ★★★★ In Love. Books that I especially loved are in <em>green.</em> <br /> <br /> 
I'm ruthless about chucking books I am not feeling.
To <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/06/15/maria-popova-tyler-cowen-book-recommendations-transcript/">quote Tyler Cowen</a>, <br /> "People feel compelled to finish books they started. That's just a tax on your reading. Why would you do that to yourself?" <br /> 
<!--   Imagine a world where any restaurant you tried, you had to keep on going there for days or weeks. You&rsquo;d hardly ever go out to eat. <br /> Take reading seriously. Develop a passion for it and view it as part of your practice as a knowledge worker to get ahead. Along the way, having fun doing so." </p> -->
